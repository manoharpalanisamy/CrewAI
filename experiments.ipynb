      "As for Multimodal AI, advancements in systems that can process and understand various forms of data like text, images, and audio are expected to significantly enhance the way we interact with technology. The multimodal model GPT-4o integrates text, vision, and potentially future audio capabilities, setting a new standard for generative and conversational AI experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the realm of language models, 2024 is set to witness the power of Small Language Models (SLMs). These models, despite their reduced size, possess considerable capabilities and, in certain cases, can perform exceptionally well. Microsoft announced a new version of its small language model, Phi-3, which can look at images and tell you what's in them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Open Source Advancements in 2024 show a thriving and accelerating AI innovation across the globe. The GitHub Accelerator welcomed 11 open source AI projects, demonstrating a stronger commitment to funding open source developers. Also, in 2024, open-source pre-trained AI models are gaining significant traction, empowering businesses to accelerate growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, Quantum Advancements in 2024 are expected to see a shift from physical qubits to error-corrected logical qubits. This year marks a significant moment for quantum technology, with increased global collaboration in quantum research. Atom Computing's announcement of a 1,225-qubit quantum computer, nearly tripling IBM's Osprey, is a clear indication of this.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, 2024 is shaping up to be a transformative year in the field of AI and Quantum technology, with significant advancements anticipated across a range of areas. From generative and multimodal AI to smaller language models, open-source developments, and quantum computing, the future holds exciting possibilities for these cutting-edge technologies.\n",
